Target Blank is a library of React components based on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), designed to help developers create lightweight, engaging user interfaces. Our aim is to help you complete your projects by offering a **wide range of validated and designer-proposed components**, pre-built for easy use and modification.

Our aim is to continually enrich this collection, so that React developers can quickly develop and implement their interface.

## A library unlike any other

In the spirit of open-source, **Target Blank isn't a classic library** like those that exist everywhere with npm. To make it easy for everyone, our components only need to be installed and imported into your projects.

## Why Target Blank?

1. **Open Source & Fully Customizable**: Target Blank gives you complete control with full access to the source code. Instead of wrapping components or overriding styles, you can edit them at their core to perfectly match your design system and specific needs.

2. **Seamlessly Complements to any other library**: Target Blank expands your toolkit with a wide range of animated components that are easy to integrate and extend.

3. **Built with Tailwind CSS and Motion**: Leveraging the power of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), Target Blank integrates smoothly into your existing projects while following best practices for styling and animation.

4. **Ready-to-Use Components**: Every component in Target Blank comes fully ready-to-use out of the box, offering dynamic and modern UI experiences. With [Motion](https://motion.dev/) at its core, even developers with no animation background can build fluid and engaging interfaces effortlessly.
